# PanoramicData.Blazor

UI components for Blazor.  Try it out on our [Demo page](https://panoramicdata.github.io/PanoramicData.Blazor/)!

We needed the following Blazor UI components for several projects, including [ReportMagic v3.0](https://reportmagic.net):

* Block Overlay
* Table
* Pager
* Tree
* Splitter
* File Explorer
* Context Menu
* Toolbar
* Form
* File Modal

Rather than buying them in, we made our own, Open Sourced them on Github and made them *free* (both speech and beer).

More will follow, as *we* need them.  However, we are much more excited to see:

* what *you* need
* your Pull Requests

Please do contribute!

## Dependencies

- Bootstrap (*a default Library in a new blazor project*) >= **5.1.3**

## Component Documentation

To improve our project's documentation and make it easier to work with our Blazor components, we've introduced a new automated documentation generation process.

**What's New?**

*   **`ComponentDocumentation.md`**: A new markdown file in the root of the project that provides a comprehensive overview of all `PD*` Blazor components, including their parameters and descriptions.
*   **Automated Generation**: This file is generated by a PowerShell script named `GenerateDocs.ps1`. This script scans all components and their parameters, extracting the XML summary comments to build the documentation.
*   **Improved Code Comments**: All components have been updated with XML summary comments for their parameters to ensure the generated documentation is as complete as possible.

**How to Use It**

To update the documentation, simply run the `GenerateDocs.ps1` script from a PowerShell terminal in the project root:

```powershell
.\GenerateDocs.ps1
```

The script will automatically detect any changes to the documentation and prompt you to commit them. Please note that running this script is currently a manual step required to keep the documentation in sync with the code.

**Your Contribution**

To ensure the documentation remains complete and accurate, please add XML summary comments to any new components or parameters you create. For example:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// A brief description of the parameter.
/// </summary>
[Parameter]
public string MyParameter { get; set; }
```

This automated process ensures that our documentation stays up-to-date with the codebase, making it easier for everyone to understand how to use our components. It will also help new team members get up to speed more quickly.
