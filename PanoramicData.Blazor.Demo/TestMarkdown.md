## Paragraphs

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

This text is ***really important***.

## Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

Nested Blockquotes:

## Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
- Fourth item

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

- 1968\. A great year!
- I think 1969 was second best.

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

## Code blocks

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.


## Images

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](/png/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)

3. Close the file.

## Code

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>
